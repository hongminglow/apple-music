# Apple Music — PENCIL prototype

This repository contains an experimental Apple Music–style React + Tailwind application generated from a PENCIL (.pen) design frame using the PENCIL AI tooling. It's a prototype meant only for testing the PENCIL → code workflow and exploring generated UI output.

Important notes:

- **Experimental:** This project is a demo of the PENCIL design-to-code feature. Expect rough edges, simplified assets, and placeholder data.
- **Not production-ready:** Do not use this code as-is in production; it is intended for testing and evaluation only.
- **Attribution:** The UI structure and visuals were produced from the included `pencil-new.pen` file.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Feedback or issues

If you find problems with the generated output or want improvements for the PENCIL export, please open an issue in this repository describing the mismatch and attaching the relevant .pen frame or screenshots.
